/* LOOPS


-They allow us to repeat a block of code with diufferent results without having to type each thing in every time-

-FOR LOOPS-

When you know how many times to loop through code.

Ex:
*/
for (var i = 0; i < 0; i++){
    
    
}
/* the first staement is the satrting condition, the second is the defined position for the loop to run to, 
and the third either increses or decreases a value based off the code*/

/*

-FOR-IN LOOPS-

Usually used for objects specifically.


*/

var animal = {species : "cat"};
/*
for (species in animal){

    
}
*/

/*

-WHILE LOOPS-

Runs through a block of code based on if a statement is true.

*/

var a = 1;

while (a < 2){
    i++;
    
}
/*

This expression is true, since a = 1, and 1 is less than 2, it runs the block of code and i keeps adding in value.
*/
